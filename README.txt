#Tiny python app that is calculating you some physics values, based on the variables:  

Fahrenheit to Celsius converation

Celsius to Fahrenheit convertation

Train force, that is calculated like train mass * train acceleration ( they are given now as constants, but i will do them as an input later)

bomb energy, that is calculated like bomb mass * constant c

train work, that is calucated like train mass * train force * train distance
